### Chess Engine in C - README.md

#### Introduction
This README.md provides an overview of a chess engine implemented in the C programming language. The chess engine is designed to play chess games, analyze positions, and make optimal moves based on various algorithms and strategies.

#### Features
- **Chess Game Play**: Play full chess games against the engine.
- **Move Generation**: Generate legal moves for a given chess position.
- **Board Representation**: Represent the chess board and pieces efficiently in memory.
- **Search Algorithms**: Implement search algorithms like Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning for move selection.
- **Evaluation Function**: Evaluate chess positions to determine the best move.
- **Integration with GUI**: Interface the engine with a graphical user interface for interactive gameplay.

#### Structure of the Chess Engine
The chess engine in C consists of the following components:
1. **Board Representation**: Efficiently store the chess board and piece positions.
2. **Move Generation**: Generate legal moves for each piece on the board.
3. **Search Algorithm**: Implement a search algorithm to find the best move.
4. **Evaluation Function**: Evaluate the board position to determine the best move.
5. **User Interface**: Interface with a user interface for human interaction.

#### How to Use the Chess Engine
1. **Compile the Code**:
   - Compile the C code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) on your system.
2. **Run the Chess Engine**:
   - Execute the compiled binary to start the chess engine.
3. **Play Chess**:
   - Play chess games against the engine by entering moves using algebraic notation.
4. **Analyze Positions**:
   - Analyze specific chess positions and let the engine suggest the best moves.
5. **Customize the Engine**:
   - Modify the engine's algorithms, strategies, and evaluation functions to enhance performance.

#### Future Enhancements
- **Optimization**: Optimize the algorithms and data structures for faster move generation and evaluation.
- **Endgame Tablebases**: Implement endgame tablebases for optimal play in endgame scenarios.
- **Machine Learning**: Integrate machine learning techniques to improve the engine's decision-making capabilities.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
